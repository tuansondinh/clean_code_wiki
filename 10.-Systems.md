## 10.1 How would you build a city?

Cities work because:
1. "...cities have teams of people who manage particular parts of the city..." (water, power etc.) S.154
2. they evolved from appropriate complexity/abstraction and modularity

- Clean Code -> organize at lower levels of abstraction
- How to stay clean in high level abstraction / system level?

## 10.2 Separate **Constructing** a System from **Using** it

- **construction** is different process from **use**
- "The **separation of concerns** is one of the oldest and most important design techniques in our craft." S.154 

BAD - Lazy Initialization/Evaluation - mixing up startup and runtime logic:
- good: constructs object when really needed; faster startup; null is never returned
- bad: hard-coded dependency on ```MyServiceImpl```-> can't compile without resolving these dependencies
```java
public Service getService() {
 if (service == null)
  service = new MyServiceImpl(...); // Good enough default for most cases? return service;
}
```
"...we should make sure that we have a global, consistent strategy for resolving our major dependencies." S.155

## 10.3 Separation of Main (S.155)
- "move all aspects of construction to ```main```, or modules called by ```main```..."
- "...design the rest of the system assuming that all objects have been constructed and wired up appropriately.
- "The main function builds the objects necessary for the system, then passes them to the application, which simply uses them."
- "...the application has no knowledge of main or of the construction process."

## 10.4 Factories
- application can say **when** an object gets created -> use ABSTRACT FACTORY pattern
- construction is still seperate from app code

## 10.5 Dependency Injection
- powerful method to separate _construction_ from _use_
- use of _Inversion of Control _ to dependency management
- IoC "...moves secondary responsibilities from an object to other objects, that are dedicated to the purpose" (S.157) -> supports SRP 
- an object should not be responsible for instantiating dependencies -> should pass it too other mechanism -> inverting control

WIP

## 10.6 Scaling Up
- start small with low complexity, then expand -> iterative and incremental agility 
"Test-driven development, refactoring, and the clean code they produce make this work at the code level." S.158

On System Level: "Their architectures can grow incrementally, if we maintain the proper separation of concerns." S.158
WIP
