## 6.1 Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes
Don't use Return Codes. Reasons: "The caller must check for errors immediately after the call. Unfortunately, it’s easy to forget." S.104
Also we don't have clean separation between error handling and "normal" code.

BAD:
```java
DeviceHandle handle = getHandle(DEV1); // Check the state of the device
if (handle != DeviceHandle.INVALID) {
  // Save the device status to the record field 
  retrieveDeviceRecord(handle);
} else{
  logger.log("Invalid handle for: " + DEV1.toString());
}
```

GOOD:
```java
try {
  getHandle(DEV1);
} catch (HandleError e) {
  logger.log(e);
}
```
## 6.2 Start with writing try/catch/finally
"This helps you define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what goes wrong with the code that is executed in the try." S.105

## 6.3 Use Unchecked Exceptions
Don't use checked Exceptions.
"The price of checked exceptions is an Open/Closed Principle violation. If you throw a checked exception from a method in your code and the catch is three levels above, you must declare that exception in the signature of each method between you and the catch. This means that a change at a low level of the software can force signature changes on many higher levels." S.107

## 6.4 Provide Context with Exceptions
"Each exception that you throw should provide enough context to determine the source and location of an error." S.107
- use informative error messages containing the operation that failed and type of failure

## 6.5 Define Exception Classes in Terms of a Caller’s Needs

"... when we define exception classes in an application, our most important concern should be **how they are caught**." S.107

Following code contains a lot of duplication. (third-party library/API call)
BAD:

```java
ACMEPort port = new ACMEPort(12);
try { 
  port.open();
} catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
  reportPortError(e);
  logger.log("Device response exception", e);
} catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
  reportPortError(e); 
  logger.log("Unlock exception", e);
} catch (GMXError e) { 
  reportPortError(e);
  logger.log("Device response exception");
} finally {
  ...
}
```

Use a wrapper class "...that catches and translates exceptions thrown by the ACMEPort class" S.108

```java
LocalPort port = new LocalPort(12); 
try {
  port.open();
} catch (PortDeviceFailure e) {
  reportError(e);
  logger.log(e.getMessage(), e);
} finally {
  ...
}

public class LocalPort { 
  private ACMEPort innerPort;
  public LocalPort(int portNumber) { 
    innerPort = new ACMEPort(portNumber);
  }
  public void open() { 
    try {
      innerPort.open();
    } catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
      throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
    } catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
      throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
    } catch (GMXError e) {
      throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
    } 
  } ...
}
```

## 6.6 Define the normal Flow / Special Case Pattern

Using exceptions we have a nice separation between business logic and error handling.
But be careful and avoid following mistake, where "...the exception clutters the logic." S.109

BAD
```java
try {
  MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
  m_total += expenses.getTotal();
} catch(MealExpensesNotFound e) { 
  m_total += getMealPerDiem();
}
```
Solution: Use the Special Case Pattern

"You create a class or configure an object so that it handles a special case for you. When you do, the client code doesn’t have to deal with exceptional behavior. That behavior is encapsulated in the special case object." S. 110

GOOD:
```java
MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
m_total += expenses.getTotal();

public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {
 public int getTotal() {
 // return the per diem default
 }
}
```

Now in this example ```getTotal()``` will always return an object. If no meal -> object will return the _per diem_

## 6.7 Don't Return Null
If we return null, we need to always check for null. If we forget to check, the application can fail on us.

BAD:
```java
List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();
if (employees != null) {
 for(Employee e : employees) {
 totalPay += e.getPay();
 }
}
```
SOLUTION:

"If you are tempted to return null from a method, consider throwing an exception or returning a SPECIAL CASE object instead." S.110

```java
List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();
for(Employee e : employees) {
 totalPay += e.getPay();
}

public List<Employee> getEmployees() {
 if( .. there are no employees .. )
 return Collections.emptyList();
}
```
## 6.8 Don't Pass Null
"Unless you are working with an API which expects you to pass null, you should avoid passing null in
your code whenever possible." S.111 -> to avoid run time errors, exceptions 

## 6.9 Conclusion
"Clean code is readable, but it must also be robust.[...] We can
write robust clean code if we see error handling as a separate concern." S.112
